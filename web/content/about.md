### More About Scouting
The adventure starts with Cub Scouting, a year-round family program designed for boys in the 1st through 5th grades, or 6 to 11 years of age. The program emphasizes shared leadership, learning about the community, family understanding, character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.

Young boys grow up fast. Give your son a valuable gift by encouraging him to join Cub Scouting today. The time you invest in him today will make a difference in the person he becomes tomorrow.

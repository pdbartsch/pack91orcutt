Cub Scout Pack 91, Orcutt, is a family-friendly Scouting group. We strive to provide a complete Cub Scout experience to our scouts. Dedicated trained leadership and a strong structure are key to our success. We are an adventure Pack, offering opportunities to camp, hike, learn and serve our community while having fun together.

You can always find up-to-date information here at our website, or call us at (805) 253-CUBS with questions about our Pack or upcoming events.

### More About Scouting
The adventure starts with Cub Scouting, a year-round family program designed for children in kindergarten through 5th grades, or 5 to 11 years of age. The program emphasizes shared leadership, learning about the community, family understanding, character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.

Young children grow up fast. Give your child a valuable gift by encouraging them to join Cub Scouting today. The time you invest in them today will make a difference in the person they becomes tomorrow.

You can find out more about the Cub Scout program by visiting the official [Boy Scouts of America website.](http://www.scouting.org)

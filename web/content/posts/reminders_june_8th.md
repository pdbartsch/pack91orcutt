## 3. Pack 91 Parent Committee Meeting Sunday, June 10th:
#### When:
Immediately following the pack meeting. We'll have a brief and informal parent meeting.  The kids will be waiting on us, so we'll try to keep this one to 15 minutes with follow up through the Pack email list. Longer sessions to plan activities for next year will occur later in the summer.  All Pack parents are always welcome and volunteers are needed.

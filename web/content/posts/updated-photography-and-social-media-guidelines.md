We've updated our welcome packet in order to address questions about photography and social media sharing.  The behavior guidelines have also been revised slightly to include all scout family members and guests. 

The biggest change is that **our pack will no longer share photos of our scouts on social media, through our pack website, or in any publication**. For the safety of our scouts, **we ask that photography at any Pack 91 event be limited to only the scout for whom you are a legal guardian**. We don’t plan to retroactively remove old social media posts at this time, but we’re happy to do so by request.

**The most up to date version of the welcome packet is always available [at this link. ](/files/welcome.pdf)**

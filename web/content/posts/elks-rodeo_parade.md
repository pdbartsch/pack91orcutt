It's Elks Rodeo and Parade time again, which means an opportunity to participate in the parade, and also earn some funds for our pack.  We don't have a group entry, but the Elks offer donations to us if we carry banners in the parade (even more fun and rewarding).

The 75th annual Elks Rodeo runs from May 31 to June 3, 2018.  The parade will take place on **Saturday, June 2nd**.  You must be in neat and clean Class A uniforms in order to participate. In the past, the Elks have paid $50.00 per banner carried to each unit. This has benefited our local units for several years now.

The parade will start promptly at 8:45 AM, so **show up time will be at 8:00 AM on the corner of E. Mill St. and N. Broadway**.  There is a strip of grass in that area that we will meet up at to organize ourselves.  Terry Pew will be at the parade starting line at the corner of Mill St. and N. Broadway and will give directions to the scouts from there.

**At the end of the parade, scouts and parents shall meet be at the end of the line in front of the Vallarta grocery store on the corner of E. Enos Dr. and S. Broadway**.  If parents or leaders are not there to meet up with your scouts, they will not be permitted to leave the vicinity, unless previous arrangements have been made.

Terryâ€™s cell phone is (805) 714-9188.

See you there!

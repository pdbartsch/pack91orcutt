### Pack 91 had fun over the summer! 
Our Scouts had opportunities to attend camps, go geocaching, launch rockets, play native plant bingo, learn shooting sports hike and fish.

### We have a plan to continue the fun throughout this school year. 
Now we're planning for another fun year!  We're using <a href="https://www.scoutbook.com/mobile/dashboard/calendar/"> ScoutBook</a> as our Pack calendar so please go there for the most up to date events calendar.  This outline is subject to change. Den activities are up to your den leader.

### UPDATE October 2018: Program plan outline transitioned to ScoutBook Calendar

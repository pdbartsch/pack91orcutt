Pacific Coast District Day Camp Camp will be a fun and educational time for the kids and also fulfills one aspect of the [Cub Scout Outdoor Activity Award](https://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Outdoor_Activity_Award)!

All registered Cub Scouts are welcome and there will also be a tot-lot for siblings to attend while their parent volunteers at the camp. If your child is not a registered Cub Scout, reach out to us and we'll help get them [registered](/join) before signing up for day camp.

Each Day Scouts will participate in a Shooting Activity (BB Guns, Archery, and Sling Shots), Cooking Activity, Scout Skill, Physical Fitness, Craft, and STEM related activities.  The theme this year is Ocean Discovery.

[Here's a flyer](/files/daycamp2019/SaveTheDateOceanDiscoveryCamp.docx) with more info.

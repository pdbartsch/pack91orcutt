There has been a lot of discussion recently on the **decision by the Boy Scouts of America** to open the program to both girls and boys.  This expansion of the program is often referred to as *Family Scouting*.

**Pack 91** is open to both girls and boys.  Each Den will remain gender specific.  Each Den also strives to remain age specific although there is some potential to combine girl Dens across multiple age groups until there is enough interest to make up full Dens for each age group.  

As has always been the case, Dens can only exist with the help of adult volunteers to lead them.
We hope to have the interest and volunteers to accomodate all interested children.  In the event that our Pack doesn't have the number of Scouts or adult leaders to accomodate every interested child, we will do our best to recommend other local options correct for your child.

The BSA recently published a document answering some of the questions that scouting families have had regarding the new Family Scouting program.

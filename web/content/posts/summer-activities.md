Hi Scouts, Scout families and future Scouting families!  Please join us for some fun pack activities throughout the summer.  As you know the scouting year normally slows down a bit when school is out. Your dens may not meet as frequently and we won't have the more formal pack meetings, but we will be doing **plenty of fun activities**.  I hope you'll try to make all of them and **please bring your friends and family along**.

Please bring water, sunscreen, adequate footwear and a light snack to all hikes.  


Check back here often, subscribe to our [calendar](/events-calendar) or follow us on [Facebook](https://fb.me/Pack91Orcutt).  We hope to add even more fun activities throughout the summer.  [Here is the upcoming events flyer](/files/2018SummertimePack91Events.pdf) we passed out at the June 10, 2018 Pack meeting.  If you have suggestions or would like to lead an activity please contact us through [this feedback form.](https://goo.gl/forms/VXiXt1n0fxWLlfYp1).

[**National Summertime Pack Award:**](https://www.scouting.org/awards/awards-central/national-summertime/) **Scouts** who participate in three summertime pack events (one each in June, July, and August) are eligible to receive the [National Summertime Award pin!](https://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/National_Summertime_Award).  **Dens** with an average attendance of at least half their members at the three summer pack events are eligible for a colorful den participation ribbon.

## ~~1. Orcutt Hill Hike~~ COMPLETED
Family Hike. Moderate 2.25 mile loop.  We'll be learning to identify some of the more common native plants along the way. 

**Update:** Attendance was good and the kids had fun.  Thanks to all who joined us!  
**We had 32 people on the hike** (18 children & 14 adults)! 

## ~~2. Rocket Building and Launching~~ COMPLETED
Materials provided. Another chance to build your own air powered rocket. These things fly about 200 feet!  Bring a friend!

**Update:** Phew!  We made a lot of rockets!  Thanks to all who joined us!  
**We had over 25 kids at this one** 

## ~~3. Intro to Geocaching at Los Flores Ranch~~ COMPLETED

This outdoor treasure hunting game uses GPS or your SMARTPHONE to locate hidden containers called geocaches. Learn how to find them in a fun setting. GPSâ€™s (limited amount) provided or please download the free app at geocaching.com. There will be some off trail hiking. Each participant will receive a cool geocaching swag courtesy of MicroGeoCaches.

**Update:** The volunteers at LFRP did a great job teaching compass, mapping, and GPS skills to the young crowd. Most scouts who reserved one of the limited spots showed up.  We all had a great time.

## ~~4. Huck Finn Fishing Derby~~ COMPLETED
Sponsored by Santa Maria Breakfast Rotary & Santa Maria Valley Sportsman's Association during Family Day In the Park/ Healthy Kids Day at Waller Park.

**Update:** They call it fishing not catching but I did see one of our scout families haul in a big catfish.  SMV Sportman's Association was very welcoming and helpful to provide gear and free entry to our scouts.

## ~~5. Los Flores Ranch Hike~~ COMPLETED
Family Hike. Moderate 2 mile loop. We should find dinosaur bones!

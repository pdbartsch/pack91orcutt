## [DOWNLOAD PACK 91 WELCOME PACKET HERE](/files/welcome.pdf)

A common complaint from new scouting families is that it takes a year or two to figure out what's going on.  How is a den different from a pack?  What do I need to buy at the scout store?  When and where are we meeting?  Who runs this pack?  What do we spend money on as a pack?  Which forms do I need to fill out?

We've tried to begin answering these questions in our new welcome packet.  This information will be expanded on as other frequently asked questions arise, and we encourage you to submit topic suggestions through our [feedback form.](https://goo.gl/forms/VXiXt1n0fxWLlfYp1)

**The most up to date version of the packet will always be available [at this link: ](/files/welcome.pdf)**

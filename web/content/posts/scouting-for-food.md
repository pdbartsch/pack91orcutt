## Why?
We have given thanks for all of the great things we have, now it’s time to help others less fortunate than ourselves.  Scouting for Food is Scouting’s National Good Turn event.  As scouts we have pledged to help others, now it is time to make a commitment to do that.
Food donations will be delivered to the food bank for distribution.  The Food Bank is located on Foster Road in Santa Maria.


### When do we start?
Pack 91 will begin collecting food at 9 am on Saturday, January 26th.  Please meet at Orcutt Academy High school (shown on map).
The food bank will be open from 10 am to 1 pm for drop-offs.

### How do we ask for food?
Our scouts will knock on doors the day of and politely ask for non perishable donations to the local food bank.
Class A uniforms are encouraged.  If the scouts say the words 'food bank' with their uniforms on, that normally does the trick.  Our community is very generous.

### Safety
Our scouts will “Buddy up” and we will go over safety before we begin.
Scouts will not be allowed to enter homes and need to watch for traffic.
There will be adults supervising every group.

### What do we put the donations in?
Please bring some old grocery bags or boxes with you on the day of collecting. Please also bring wagons if you have them.

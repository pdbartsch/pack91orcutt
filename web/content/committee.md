Parent committee meetings are normally held the second Sunday of the month from 6:30-8:00PM.  All scout parents/guardians are welcome.  This is the time where many upcoming events are planned so it is your opportunity to help shape the pack.  We're always looking for more volunteers and we do have open positions on the committee.
[Here's some more information on the pack committee](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/leaders/about/the-pack/pcomm/)

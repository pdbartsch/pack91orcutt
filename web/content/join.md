How To Join
Anytime is a great time to join Pack 91!

Call us at (805) 253-CUBS to find out about our next Pack activity, and how you can join us.

Boys are placed in a "Den" based on their school grade, which will meet about every other week.  Once a month a Pack meeting for all the boys is also held.

Pack 91 also schedules numerous fun outings for the boys that include activities like a visit to a waterpark, campout, pool-swim day, hike, canned food collection, Pine Wood Derby, etc. Trained volunteer leaders help the boys advance in character through fun activities. Come join us !
